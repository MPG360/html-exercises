# Gibb Reflection Assignment

This assignment is about testing my reflective cycle model. using the Gibb Reflection. In this assignment I've to design a fictitious website for Andy's Autos.

# Feeling

Since this is my first time building a website, I've to apply so far what I've learnt in web desiging in order help me guide the project. How to start maybe an issue, but confident at the end I would have gain a experience in creating a website and understanding the Gibb Reflective cycle model.
